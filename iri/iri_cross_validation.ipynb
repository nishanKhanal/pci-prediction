Since we pass our entire data to the cross validation, it splits the data into k-folds and perfroms training in k-1 folds and validation on the remaining 1 fold. This is repeated for k-1 times with the validaiton set being different each time. This results in the average MSE being almost the same for each degree. The validation error changes for each degree because it is working on different subset of data.'\n"
